# Anime App

# Why did I make this app?
I love anime and this was a project I was passionate about. I wanted to cut my teeth to see if I could even make this using instructions from youtube.

# How's it made
(I used a tutorial to help me with this)
I also created this to help me with using APIs (jikan). I set up a component for each feature: (addtolist, animeinfo,removeFromlist,animeList) Once I was able to add the API, I needed to add (add to a list), remove, and show anime titles as well as a description and rating of each. I then connected each component to clickable buttons.
